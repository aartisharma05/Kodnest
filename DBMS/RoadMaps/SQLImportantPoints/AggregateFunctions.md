#Some Important Points
 - Commonly used aggregate functions are â€“ MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), AVG(), and SUM().
 - Till 2 levels ( maximum ) can we nest Aggregate functions
 - Aggregate functions in SQL operate on a group of values and return a single result.
 - They are often used with the GROUP BY clause to summarize the grouped data.
 - Aggregate function operates on non-NULL values only (except COUNT)
 - If we're having string kinda data in any column and we apply MIN(column) or Max(column) it'll give the result of min or max alphabetical order.
 - SUM() returns the summation of all non-NULL values    
 - MAX() return the maximum value for the specified column name
